Most of the issues had been assigned, but then suddenly a new project was added to the list, whose tech stack was based on python and I was sure that I wanted to contribute to it. The project was in itself also very much attractive as I had always wanted to build a CLI tool, but never had done one.\n      <br/> My project was <strong><Link to='https://github.com/dibyasonu/nlt-github'>NLT-Github</Link></strong> a CLI interface to access github.\n      <br/>My mentor for the project was <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dibyasonu\">Dibya Ranjan Jena</a></strong>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Contribution:</h3>\n      <p>\n        In a span of 20 odd  days that I worked this project for I was able to raise 6 pull requests and 5 of which are merged as of now and 1 still open.\n        In these pull requests I managed to work on 8 issues of which 5 have been closed and with the last pr two more may get closed. \n      </p>\n      <div className=\"table\">\n        <table>\n          <tr>\n            <th>\n              No.\n            </th>\n            <th>\n              Pull Request\n            </th>\n            <th>\n              Description\n            </th>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              1\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              delete user bug fix and allow read function for Mac Os\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              As a part of first pr I managed to fix the delete user functionality of config. \n              <br/>Also the file path where specific to linux and windows which I then modified to accomadate Mac0S \n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              2\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              encrypt json data before writing to .nlt\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              Uses cryptography fernet module to encrypt the json data to stored so that the file passwords can't be seen directly. \n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              3\n            </td>\n            <td>\n            List Repository in paginated fashion and basic view profile\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              Two functionalities were added:<br/>\n              <code>list_repos</code> which list repos belonging to a person<br/>\n              <code>view_profile</code> which shows basic information about user\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              4\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              Add pull request options\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              functionality to view, checkout , merge and comment on pull request of particular repository was added\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              5\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              add smart gitignore\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              partially smart gitignore list was made which got rearranged in prefrence based of the file extemsions used\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td>\n              6\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              add readme\n            </td>\n            <td>\n              attempt to create an awesome readme, with badges, gifs, usecases etc was made.\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n      <p>\n        I always wanted to get into a opensource project and give some contributions and I needed a project or something to keep me busy during winter vaccations. \n        So without a second thought I had made up my mind to get into KWOC and I can say it has been a great journey.\n        Not only was this project in itself a great learning experience but it also prooved to be an inspiration to work on an independent side project <a href=\"\">Drive-CLI</a>.<br/>\n        I would recommend more and more people to start contributing to such events which can be very usefull starting point for beginners.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Update:</h3>\n      <ul>\n       <li>The last standing pull request was merged to Dev branch on 17th of January and will be hopefully merged to master as well soon.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default SecondPage\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/kwoc-1cc05613f01a3924f5ba296509d5e927.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
